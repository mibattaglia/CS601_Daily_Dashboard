# CS601_Daily_Dashboard

This web application is inspired by Google Now's card design and layout from an older version of Android. There are two "cards" on the website: one that displays the current
date and weather (which can be hidden) and the other is a fully functional calendar with keyboard navigation. 

The user has the option the change the main color of the application as well as use a photo from NASA's APOD API to change the background of the entire website.

The dates presented on the calendar are calculated dynamically and are accurate (with leap years) up to the year 2100.

Future features include: the ability the add events/notes to the calendar that persist between sessions.
